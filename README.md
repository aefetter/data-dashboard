Here's my responsive data dashboard made for MEJO487: Intermediate Interactive Media at UNC. I used publically available Chapel Hill police logs and sorted for open container and loud noise complaints in Chapel Hill. I used D3 to make responsive and interactive charts to visualize where and when these complaints were occuring.

Here were the assignment requirements:
- Responsive Design (Bootstrap)
- Styles must mimic/copy a major publisher like NYTimes, WashPost, Vox, ESPN, etc.
- Use of Charts and Graphs (Suggest Chart JS, C3.js, or HighCharts highcharts.com/))
- Featured Tabular Display of a subset of data (Top 10, Specific tag, or date)
- Tabular Display of ALL data (suggest AG Grid or  datatables.net ))
- Use of strong UI elements, (tabs, accordion, sliders, overlays, etc.)
- Use of any data from data.gov or other publically available source
