            <p> Chapel Hill, North Carolina is home to around 51,000 permanent residents. That number jumps to about 77,000 people when including the student population. Unsurprisingly, a large and lively student population means that the local police logs may show some trends. From 2010-2024, over 3500 loud noise complaints were recorded by Chapel Hill Police Department. Where were these complaints and when did they occur? Not surprisingly, they occured mainly at night, surrounding party weekends and school celebrations, and near student housing close to Franklin Street.</p>

                <p>Many of the noise complaints are clustered near student houses and apartment complexes. Since UNC has its own campus police, Chapel Hill Police typically only go to off campus housing. Click on the markers to see the details of the log from that specific location, including when and where the noise complaint occured. Select the year to see noise complaints by specific dates, like Halloween or a big win against Duke. </p>
